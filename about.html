          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>This project demonstrates the creation of a modern and responsive to-do list application. The application consists of a visually appealing interface that is designed to be user-friendly and functional on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. </p>

            <p>The application features a fixed navigation bar with a logo, an "About" section, and a responsive hamburger menu for small screens. The navigation bar remains at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls, providing easy access to different sections of the website.</p>
            
            <p>The main functionality of the application allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. It uses custom styles for checkboxes and delete buttons to ensure a consistent appearance across different browsers. The responsive design ensures that the interface adapts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience on various devices.</p>
            
            <p> The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the application. HTML structures the content, CSS styles the interface, and JavaScript adds interactivity and manages the functionality of the to-do list. Media queries in CSS are used to create a responsive design that adapts the layout and styles based on the screen size.</p>
            
            <p> Overall, this to-do list application showcases the power of combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly web application that provides a seamless experience across different devices and browsers.</p>
